Bootstrap Website
In this website, I chose to name it Bootstrap Portfolio just for now. 
In the index.html file and home page, I added the Bootstrap CDN element. I used container-fluid  for all my pages to structure my layout.
I made some edits to the navbar from the default Bootstrap. I added my own color and font names.
On the contact page, I added the Bootstrap layout for forms. I included the first name and last name in the form's layout and changed the button to btn success.
The first and last names are in a Bootstrap grid layout side by side.
