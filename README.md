Bootstrap Website
In this website, I chose to name it Bootstrap Portfolio just for now. 
In the index.html file and home page, I added the Bootstrap CDN element. I used container-fluid  for all my pages to structure my layout.
I made some edits to the navbar from the default Bootstrap. I added my own color and font names.
On the contact page, I added the Bootstrap layout for forms. I included the first name and last name in the form's layout and changed the button to btn success.
The first and last names are in a Bootstrap grid layout side by side. 
Verification classes were also added, and I joined the form and the table on one page.

The two Bootstrap buttons with utility classes are visible on the home page (index.html) below the circle profile image. The circular image is below the main image of a cube image I picked. I used the img-fluid class and placed it into a fluid container. If you toggle from tablet view and phone view, you will see the button disappear, while the other is visible on all screens. 

The navigation bar has home, about, and contact sections. The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu in tablet and phone screen views. 

The pages seem to be responsive except for this glitch box in the right corner, at the bottom of the contact page, in the phone/ mobile view.
